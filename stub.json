Project topic: THE TRAVELING TRAVELING PROBLEM EXTENDED TO INCLUDE LIMITATIONS IN THE FORM OF TIME WINDOWS. The project consists of: 1. Preparation of test data in the JSON format (prepare a ready-made file, it should be a small instance that can be easily tested on later created algorithms or presented in analog form) 2. Preparation of a test data generator ($n$ - order of the problem) 3. Preparation of a greedy and randomized greedy algorithm 4. Preparation of an algorithm for a full overview of possible solutions (brute-force) 5. Preparation of a metaheuristic.","md5":"1be7018d675eb407873cd59753408bc7"}]}
